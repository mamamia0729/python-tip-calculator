# Tiny Tip Calculator

This is a simple command-line Python program designed to calculate the total bill amount, including tip, and then split it among a specified number of people. It was created as a hands-on exercise to reinforce fundamental Python concepts.

## Concepts Demonstrated:

* **Data Types:** Utilization of `float` for monetary values and `int` for counting people.
* **Variables:** Storing user inputs and intermediate calculation results.
* **Arithmetic Operators:** Extensive use of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for calculations.
* **Operator Precedence:** Ensuring correct order of operations in tip calculation.
* **Input/Output:** Taking user input and displaying formatted results using `input()` and `print()`.
* **Basic String Formatting:** Using f-strings to present output clearly.

## Potential Future Enhancements:

* Add error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).
* Implement a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting the script.
* Offer an option for custom rounding.
